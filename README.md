**Project Overview**
This project aims to build a predictive model for Santander Bank to identify potentially dissatisfied customers early through analysis of their account data. Early identification will allow the bank to proactively take steps to improve customer satisfaction before loyalty is lost.

**Data**
The data contains hundreds of anonymized features for existing Santander customers. Target variable indicates if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience. Various account attributes, transaction records, and customer demographic/profile fields are included as predictor variables.

**Analysis Steps**
The following steps will be undertaken:

Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and outliers
Data preprocessing including missing data imputation and feature engineering
Feature selection to identify most predictive fields
Train various classification algorithms and optimize hyperparameters
Evaluate model performance on blinded test set
Produce predictions on test data and submit for scoring
